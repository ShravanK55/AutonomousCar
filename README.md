# AutonomousCar
An agent that attempts to drive around a track autonomously and optimally. The agent uses Convolutional Neural Networks for learning how to drive, and racing lines for driving around the track optimally.

For a better description and understanding of the project, refer to our paper outlining the project: [Autonomous Driving Agents Using Genetic
Algorithms And Neural Networks](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19BxisnsO8s5iW-pQD7z2-bsJaRFmx_Lr/view?usp=sharing).
